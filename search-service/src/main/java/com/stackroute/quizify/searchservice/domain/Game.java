 * This "Game" class is used to get game names from our message bus(Kafka).

 * In other words, @Data generates all the boilerplate that is normally associated with simple
 * POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).
 *
 * The Annotation "@Id" is used to declare that the field "id" as the Primary Key which will be
 * Non-Null and Unique.
